# Boltzmann Machine

A python implementation of a Boltzmann machine, following the lecture notes [here](http://www.snn.ru.nl/~bertk/machinelearning/handouts_ml.pdf).

The implementation makes use of [numba](http://numba.pydata.org), a just in time compiler for Python that significantly speeds up training.
